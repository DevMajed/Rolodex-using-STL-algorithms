# Rolodex

The point of this project is to build an information manager similar to a rolodex, based on STL libarary in C++. \
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex). 

A physical rolodex is made up of cards arranged in alphabetical order by [Last Name, First Name]. Each card contains some information, usually name, address, phone number and type of business (why the person is in the rolodex). The physical mechanism of using a rolodex is turning the group of cards and flipping through them. When the last card is read, the rolodex is then at the start of the list since a rolodex is built on a circular track. 

For this project you'll implement a Card class (in Card.h and Card.cpp), a Rolodex class (in Rolodex.h and Rolodex.cpp), and a main() function (in main.cpp). \
The code in main() reads interactive commands that perform actions on its Rolodex object (like add a card, search for a card, list the rolodex cards, etc).
